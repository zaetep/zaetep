### Hello, I'm Kaden, also known across the internet as zaetep.

I'm currently pursuing an Electrical/Computer Engineering degree at Purdue Fort Wayne.
I have some experience coding in HTML/CSS, C/C++, VHDL, Python, bash script, and PowerShell script. Though, I am no expert yet.

I'm known for my small stint in music production, playing Counter-Strike semi-professionally, and my knack for solving computer problems. 
You can find me anywhere you'd like by the same username, except for my music, which is under the alias VELARIS.

I'm always looking to learn more and improve, so I've always got a bucket list of things to do.
